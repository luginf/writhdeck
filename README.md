[🇫🇷](README.fr.md) 

WrithDeck is a distraction-free text editor designed for writers using a dedicated writerdeck, whether it's a DIY prototype or a computer configured specifically for that purpose. It's fast and easy to customize. WrithDeck can run as a clean graphical application or directly in a terminal or TTY, all from a single file with no installation required.

It includes customizable inline syntax highlighting, a file browser, split view, chapter navigation through a table of contents, and a fully themeable interface, all around 4,300 lines (185 Kb) of Tcl/Tk.

Whether you're writing on a Raspberry Pi Zero with an E-ink screen, on an Android tablet, over SSH, or on your desktop, WrithDeck stays lightweight and lets you focus on your text.

It has GUI and TUI dual mode with similar behaviors, and is fully configurable.

## Usage

You will need Tcl/Tk on your system.

On Debian-based systems:

``apt install tk``

On other Linux / BSD, refer to your documentation — installation should be trivial.

On Windows, Tcl runtime binaries are available here: https://www.tcl-lang.org/software/tcltk/bindist.html

On Mac OS, use ``brew install tcl-tk`` if you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

On Haiku OS, Tcl/Tk is available via HaikuPorts (``pkgman install tcl tk``). Both GUI and TUI modes work.

Then:

```
wish writhdeck.tcl                     # GUI, file browser
wish writhdeck.tcl file.txt            # GUI, open file directly
tclsh writhdeck.tcl --no-gui           # TUI, file browser
tclsh writhdeck.tcl --no-gui file.txt  # TUI, open file directly
```

You can also run it from the terminal with ./writhdeck.tcl or, better, copy it into your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin/) for direct access.


## Command-line options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help and exit |
| `--gui` | Force GUI (Tk) mode — skip display server detection |
| `--no-gui` | Force TUI (terminal) mode |
| `--tui`, `--ng` | Aliases for `--no-gui` |

When both `--gui` and `--no-gui` are given, `--no-gui` takes precedence.


## Features

- Plain `.txt` file editor focused on distraction-free writing
- Documents stored in `~/Documents/writhdeck/` (auto-created)
- File browser: files sorted by modification date, open / create / rename / delete / scratchpad
- Word-wrapped display with configurable margins
- **Inline syntax highlighting** (GUI and TUI):
  - Headings: configurable marker (`= title =`) and Markdown (`# title`)
  - Comments: lines starting with `%` (configurable `comment_marker`)
  - Bold `**text**`, italic `//text//`, underline `__text__`, strikethrough `--text--` — all markers configurable
  - Marker characters greyed out; styled text in a configurable `color_markup`
- Table of contents overlay: jump to any heading (last selection remembered per session)
- Status bar: fully configurable zones (left / center / right) with tokens: `filename dirty sel ln col words chars clock help_bar space`
- Go to line
- UTF-8 input support
- Cursor position restored across sessions (`.writhdeck.json`)
- Configuration reloaded on each new document open (no restart needed)
- Dark/light theme toggle (`Ctrl+D` by default, configurable)
- Interface language: `lang = en` or `fr`
- **Unified browser behavior**: after closing a file, both GUI and TUI return to the file browser (configurable via `browser`)
- **Scratchpad**: temporary in-memory buffer, no disk file until explicitly saved
- **Help dialog**: shows selection word/char count when text is selected (GUI and TUI)

## Configuration

`~/Documents/writhdeck/writhdeck.ini` — sections: `[editor]`, `[behaviour]`, `[keys]`, `[profiles]`, `[schemes]`

All keyboard shortcuts are configurable via the `[keys]` section.

### Key INI options

**`[editor]`**

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `profile` | `default` | Active profile — must match a `[name]` block in `[profiles]` |
| `scheme` | `default` | Active color scheme — must match a `[name]` block in `[schemes]` |
| `console_margin_cols` | `6` | Horizontal margin in columns (TUI only) |
| `console_margin_rows` | `4` | Vertical margin in lines (TUI only) |
| `heading_marker` | `=` | Heading delimiter (`= title =`) |
| `comment_marker` | `%` | Line comment prefix; set to `0` or leave empty to disable |
| `bold_marker` | `**` | Bold inline marker; set to `0` or leave empty to disable |
| `italic_marker` | `//` | Italic inline marker; set to `0` or leave empty to disable |
| `underline_marker` | `__` | Underline inline marker; set to `0` or leave empty to disable |
| `strikethrough_marker` | `--` | Strikethrough inline marker; set to `0` or leave empty to disable |

**`[behaviour]`**

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `browser` | `1` | Return to file browser after closing a file |
| `watch_file` | `1` | Detect external file modifications and prompt to reload; `0` to disable |
| `split_shrink_margin` | `1` | Halve `margin_width` in split view (GUI); `0` to keep the full margin |
| `hemingway_mode` | `0` | When typewriter mode is active: block arrows, backspace and undo; hide status bar; double margins |
| `console_center_alert` | `1` | Center confirm dialogs (TUI); `0` = bottom bar |
| `block_cursor_gui` | `1` | Block cursor in GUI mode |
| `block_cursor_console` | `1` | Block cursor in TUI mode |
| `blink_cursor` | `0` | Blinking cursor |
| `line_numbers` | `0` | Show line numbers |
| `cursor_restore` | `1` | Restore cursor position on reopen |
| `lang` | `en` | Interface language (`en` or `fr`) |
| `dark_mode` | `1` | Dark theme; `0` = light (Solarized-style) |

**`[keys]`** — all actions are rebindable: `key_save`, `key_close`, `key_find`, `key_replace`, `key_goto`, `key_open`, `key_undo`, `key_redo`, `key_help`, `key_toc`, `key_line_numbers`, `key_fullscreen`, `key_split`, `key_split_focus`, `key_typewriter`, `key_dark_toggle`. Use Tk key names (`Control-s`, `Alt-Return`, `F11`, etc.).

**`[profiles]`** — named presets for GUI display settings. Each `[name]` block defines margins, fonts, and line spacing. Select the active profile with `profile = name` in `[editor]`. The `[default]` profile is always written by WrithDeck.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `margin_width` | `60` | Horizontal padding in pixels (GUI) |
| `margin_height` | `40` | Vertical padding in pixels (GUI) |
| `font_size` | `13` | Font size (GUI) |
| `font_family` | `Mono` | Font family (GUI); Tk resolves `Mono` to the best available monospace per OS |
| `bar_font_family` | `Mono` | Font family for the status bar (GUI) |
| `line_spacing` | `100` | Line spacing in % (GUI) |
| `bar_height` | `18` | Status bar height in pixels (GUI) |

Example:

```ini
[editor]
profile = novel

[profiles]

[novel]
margin_width    = 180
margin_height   = 80
font_size       = 18
font_family     = Noto Serif
line_spacing    = 110
bar_height      = 20
```

**`[schemes]`** — color scheme definitions. Each `[name]` block inside `[schemes]` defines a scheme with dark and light mode colors. Select the active scheme with `scheme = name` in `[editor]`. The `[default]` scheme is always written by WrithDeck and holds the current colors.

Color keys per scheme:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `color_bg` / `color_bg_alt` | Editor background (dark / light) |
| `color_fg` / `color_fg_alt` | Editor text (dark / light) |
| `color_bg_bar` / `color_bg_bar_alt` | Status bar background (dark / light) |
| `color_fg_bar` / `color_fg_bar_alt` | Status bar text (dark / light) |
| `color_bg_sel` / `color_bg_sel_alt` | Selection background (dark / light) |
| `color_heading` / `color_heading_alt` | Heading color (dark / light) |
| `color_comment` / `color_comment_alt` | Comment / dimmed line color (dark / light) |
| `color_markup` / `color_markup_alt` | Inline markup color (dark / light) |

Toggle between dark and light with `Ctrl+D` (configurable via `key_dark_toggle`).

Example — to use Solarized, add `scheme = solarized` in `[editor]`, then this block:

```ini
[schemes]

[default]

## GUI mode

This is the default mode and requires Tk.

**Display**
- Graphical window with scrollable editor and file browser
- Configurable pixel margins, font size and family, line spacing, colors (via INI)
- Inline syntax highlighting: headings, comments, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
- Line numbers: synchronized with scrolling (`line_numbers = 1`)
- Dynamic font resizing: Ctrl++ / Ctrl+- (keyboard and numpad)
- Fullscreen toggle (default: Alt+Enter, configurable)
- Built-in light theme (toggle with `dark_mode` or `Ctrl+D`)
- Optional second documents folder (`docs_dir`), shown as two labeled sections in the browser
- Clock (HH:MM) in the status bar: add the `clock` token to a status zone
- Block cursor: inverted-color rectangle (`block_cursor_gui = 1`)
- Configurable status bar height (`bar_height`); font size adapts automatically
- **Vertical split view** (F3): splits the editor into two independent panes on the same document; each pane scrolls and positions the cursor independently; F4 cycles focus between panes; the active pane is highlighted with a border
- **Typewriter / focus mode** (Ctrl+T, GUI and TUI): keeps the cursor vertically centered while typing; dims all text outside the current paragraph to reduce distractions
- **Hemingway mode** (`hemingway_mode = 1` in INI, activated with Ctrl+T): forward-only writing — arrows, backspace and undo are disabled; status bar is hidden; margins are doubled. "Write drunk, edit sober!"
- Confirm dialogs: `Tab` to navigate between buttons, `Enter` to confirm, `Escape` to cancel, `y` / `n` for direct answer

## Known bugs and limitations

- In GUI mode, line endings in word-wrapped text can cause inconsistent block cursor display. To fix this, use the non-block cursor in the .ini file (block_cursor_gui = 0).
- There is occasionally a slight delay displaying the inverted characters under the block cursor in GUI mode. See the fix above or use TUI mode.
- In TUI mode, resizing the terminal window may produce artifacts. Opening help with Ctrl+H twice refreshes the screen.
- There is no no-wrap mode (and this is not a planned feature).
- There is no tab mode (and this is not a planned feature).
- Split view is only available in GUI (a TUI adaptation may come later).
- On very long texts (over 80,000 words) and a slow CPU machine (2013 Celeron 1.1 GHz), the cursor and typing may slow down. Optimizations have been made compared to the first version, but if needed, disable word and character counting in the status bar. Writing stats remain accessible in the help dialog.
